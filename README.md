# Digital-Door-Lock
A. DESCRIPTION :
This a door lock using the digital number lock system. Here you need to set a four digit password first by using the
number pad and then you can use it as a number lock. When someone is intended to open the door ,they need to press the
password and if it matches the four digit password we set earlier and then the signal is set to 'on!' the motor which opens the
door. You are able to reset the password to another four digit number any time using the reset button. This process is done
and checked in a simulator in simulation form.(Note: You can only set 4 digits as a password).
